# solarwinds-sunburst-apt29
My field notes on APT29â€™s SUNBURST/SolarWinds campaign: what actually happened, how they evaded detection, what stood out, and actionable hunt/detection queries for security teams. Includes detection logic (KQL, Splunk, YARA, Sigma), IOC lists, and practical response checklists.
